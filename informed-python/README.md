Python implementation of [Informed](../README.md), an event-logging library that helps you understand what's happening in your application.

## Usage

### Install

I don't know :( It's Python! HALP

### Instrument

We're gonna try and make this use decorators? Does that sound reasonable?


### Configure

I'm not really sure what common practice is for configuring logging in Django. Guidance would be appreciated!
