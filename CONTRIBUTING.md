## Contributing to Informed
First off, Yay! You rock! Thank you!

Second, we have a few community and code standards

### Community Standards

* This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* You, core team members or other contributors may wind up adapting patches before merge (adding tests, improving documentation, etc.). While we may rewrite history to reduce merge conflicts, we'll do our best to make sure submitted code changes retain their original author


### Code Standards

* Patches are expected to pass CI before merging.
* Make sure you review your languages CONTRIBUTING.md document for language specific code style.
* Try to add tests if you're fixing a bug and documentation if you're submitting an enhancement.
